My name is <u><b>Rachel Abby Lara Dela Torre</b></u>. I am currently taking up BSIT
(Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) in Cavite State University.
I am 27 years old. I took up BSHRM in Jose Rixal University and stopped since we
were financially unstable at that moment.I worked in a Call Center for 8 years 
and decided to study again. Due to K-12, i was forced to go back from scratch.
I sm currently pursuing my dream and my parents' dream. If you want to learn more about me,
you can add me on <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/kulet.daw/">Facebook</a>

We were 5 in the family. I lost my father on November 2015 due to brain aneurism.
I currently have my mom, my older brother and youngest brother. I am from Bacoor, Cavite
but due to the current pandemic we have, we are now residing in Trece Martires City, Cavite
where my older brother's family resides. I have 2 nieces, Aya and Sam, and have one
coming in July. My family makes me happy. In this house where we live, everyday is
a surprise and that's what makes me happy at the moment.
